# Welcome to Our Blog Forum System

This is the beginning of our new blog system that converts Markdown posts into a fully functional blog hosted on GitHub Pages. This system allows you to easily create and manage blog content using simple Markdown files.

## How It Works

1. Write your posts in Markdown format
2. Place them in the `src/posts/` directory
3. The system automatically converts them to HTML
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages for public access

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in simple Markdown
- **Automatic Conversion**: Converts to beautiful HTML
- **Tagging System**: Organize posts with tags
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- **No Database Required**: Pure static files

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply create a new Markdown file in the `src/posts/` directory with frontmatter metadata.

## Example

```

# Your Post Title

Your post content goes here...
```

That's it! Your new post will be automatically included in the blog.
